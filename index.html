      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>
        Sports have always been the biggest hobby of mine. I played <strong>baseball</strong> in high school and have played almost every major sport competitively. My favorite to watch is <strong>football</strong>, and lately I have taken up <strong>golf</strong> more and got into it this last summer. I also enjoy playing the piano and guitar, and got my first electric guitar a few months ago. I love to go camping, fishing, hiking, and doing everything outside.

      <h3>Vacation</h3>
      <p>
        I love to travel and have been able to visit many places. Some of my trips include visiting <em>Guatemala</em> for an HEFY trip to build a health clinic, a small city below <em>Tijuana, Mexico</em> to build an orphanage, and <em>England</em> to visit my Mom's hometown. Some places I want to visit when I'm older are <strong>Greece</strong>, <strong>Brazil</strong>, <strong>Japan</strong>, <strong>China</strong>, and <strong>Iceland</strong>.
