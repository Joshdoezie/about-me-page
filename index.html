        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
            Sports have always been the biggest hobby of mine. I played baseball in high school and have played almost every major sport competetively.
            My favorite to watch is football, and lately I have taken up golf more and got into it this last summer.
            I also enjoy playing the piano and guitar, and got my first electric guitar a few months ago. 
            I love to go camping, fishing, hiking and doing everything outside.

        <h4>Vacation</h4>
        <p>
            I love to travel and have been able to visit many places. 
            Some of my trips include visiting Guatemala for an HEFY trip to build a health clinic, a small city below Tijuana, Mexico to build an orphange, and England to visit my Mom's hometown. 
            Some places I want to visit when I'm older, is Greece, Brazil, Japan, China, and Iceland.
